# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Added a reproducible `swiftql-benchmark` executable that reports raw samples,
  median, and p95 for SwiftQL construction/rendering, uncached SQLite
  preparation, statement-cache hits, reset/binding, execution, and production
  row decoding. All supported compiler lanes run a structure-only smoke test.
- Added `minOrNull(distinct:)`, `maxOrNull(distinct:)`, `sumOrNull(distinct:)`,
  `averageOrNull(distinct:)`, `groupConcatOrNull(distinct:)`, and
  `groupConcatOrNull(separator:)` APIs whose expression types represent SQLite
  NULL results.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the nonoptional `min`, `max`, `sum`, `average`, and `groupConcat`
  aggregate APIs. Their signatures remain available throughout SwiftQL 1.x.
  The canonical APIs will return optional expressions in SwiftQL 2.

### Fixed

- String concatenation now renders as an explicitly grouped binary expression,
  so `COLLATE` and surrounding operators apply with unambiguous SQLite
  precedence.
- Empty and all-NULL aggregate results can now be modeled and decoded as Swift
  `nil` through the new optional-result APIs.

### Migration

Use an `OrNull` aggregate when SQLite can return NULL:

```swift
let total = invoice.amount.sumOrNull()
```

Choose a nonoptional fallback explicitly when required:

```swift
let total = invoice.amount.sumOrNull().coalesce(0)
```

The deprecated v1 APIs retain their old result types and may still throw when
SQLite returns NULL. Projects that treat warnings as errors must migrate
deprecated calls when adopting SwiftQL 1.1.

Scalar subqueries already add an optional layer because they may return no row.
Until the nullable-subquery flattening API tracked by #162 is available, selecting
an `OrNull` aggregate inside `subquery` or `subqueryExpression` requires an
explicit type-affinity wrapper so Swift models SQLite's single NULL state:

```swift
let total: any XLExpression<Int?> = XLTypeAffinityExpression<Int?>(
    expression: subquery {
        select(invoice.amount.sumOrNull()).from(invoice)
    }
)
```
